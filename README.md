# nanoMIDI app
this is going to be archived as i simply don't have the time to manage it.

## installation
> currently only tested on Windows
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

# usage
<kbd>Delete</kbd> - toggle playback<br/>
<kbd>Home</kbd> - speed up<br/>
<kbd>End</kbd> - speed down<br/>

hope fully someone can fork this and make this what i wish it could've been!
thanks to everyone @ nanoMIDI, and all of its users!!!

> i probably wont be active as much in the nanoMIDI server but i'll pop in every now and then!!!
